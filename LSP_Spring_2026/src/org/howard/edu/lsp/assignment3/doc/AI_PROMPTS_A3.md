## Prompts
A few of the key prompts I used are as follows: 

- Can you review my raw code and redesign it to be more object-oriented (multiple classes with clearer responsibilities)? It must meet the same requirements: same inputs, same outputs, same transformations, same error handling, and same relative paths. I want 4 classes: CSVProcessor, Product, ProductTransformer, ETLPipeline. {Code pasted here.}
  
- Help me write clear and detailed Javadocs for each class and public method.

- Highlight the key differences between my original solution and the object-oriented approach (such as what OO ideas were used).
